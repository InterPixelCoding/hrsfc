## Task 2. Preparation for EPQ Activation Session on Induction Day

You will need to complete the first part and have it accessible and ready for Induction Day.

### Step 1. Rank Your 5 Key Interests  
### Your Interests Table

| Your Interest         | More Information About This                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Snooker               | I have a love-hate relationship with snooker—I find the examination of this relationship as interesting as the game itself. To be good at snooker, one must be relaxed, concentrated, and controlled. Snooker also ties into my interest for the links between statistics and psychology.                                                                                                                  |
| Fitness and Nutrition | I am interested in hypertrophy resistance training as it requires a strong mind-muscle connection; building this has many physical and mental health benefits. Through monitoring my nutrition, I am able to fully optimise by diet.                                                                                                                                                                       |
| Web Development       | I love building my own web apps for many reasons. Sometimes there is a highly specific problem that I would enjoy automating. Other times, I simply like making extravagant user interfaces. I combine building web apps with occasional 3D renders - another of my key interests.                                                                                                                         |
| 3D Art (Blender)      | Blender is an open source 3D modelling software that I have used for over 5 years. At the moment, I am particularly interested in CG integration to footage. I like to follow the latest technological innovations in photogrammetry and motion tracking.                                                                                                                                                  |
| Music                 | I've played the cello for 9 years. I have inherited my Dad's interest for musicology (the study of music), and therefore have always naturally questioned the interpretation of a piece of music, through the player as well as the score / notation. I believe choice of musical notation has a significant, unrecognised impact on the player, through both the ease of learning and natural musicality. |

### Step 2. Look at the EPQ Magazines  

| #   | Inspiration                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| --- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1   | I was inspired by web-based tools like Duolingo, which use simple visuals and interactive design to make learning easier. It made me think about how software can be designed to be more accessible and engaging for different learners.                                                                                |
| 2   | Music has always fascinated me, especially how it can be used to support communication and well-being. I’ve seen how rhythm games or interactive activities help people connect, and this made me think about ways technology could bring that same creativity into music learning.                                     |
| 3   | I’ve also been inspired by creative coding projects, like small games or animations people build online. These show how code can become a tool for play and creativity, and it gave me the idea that software for music doesn’t have to be dry or traditional.                                                          |
| 4   | Looking at EPQ examples, I noticed projects where students combined art and another field - like redesigning album covers or making music videos. That inspired me because it shows how you can use creativity to explore a deeper idea, and I wanted to do something that blends technology and music in the same way. |
| 5   | I’ve also been drawn to community-driven projects, like websites or podcasts where people contribute their own content. This gave me the idea that music tools could be collaborative, letting people share ideas rather than working in isolation.                                                                     |
